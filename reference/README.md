## Constraint Solvers
- **z3**: SMT solver used for symbolic reasoning and constraint solving

## GUI Frontends
- **Cutter**: Qt-based GUI for rizin (formerly the radare2 GUI)

## Setup

To initialize these submodules after cloning the repository:

```bash
# Option 1: Use the setup script
./scripts/setup-references.sh

# Option 2: Use git directly
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Updating

To update the reference implementations to their latest versions:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

## Note

These are external projects included as git submodules for reference and study purposes only. They are not part of the Glaurung codebase and are subject to their own licenses.
