//! Analysis-time program and memory views.
//!
//! This module provides lightweight, safe data structures used during
//! analysis: a `BinaryView` container that aggregates sections/segments
//! and image base metadata, and a `MemoryView` trait for bounded reads
//! by `core::address::Address` with simple VA↔RVA↔FileOffset translation.
