# Glaurung QF_BV real-query corpus capture (for axeyum GQ1/GQ10)

Reproducible procedure for producing the lifter-shaped QF_BV query pack that
axeyum's `axeyum-bench` (manifest v1) ingests as its client-performance
corpus. The deduplicated corpus and the ordered native profile below are
complementary GQ1/GQ10 artifacts: the former controls cold policy comparisons;
the latter preserves occurrence order and client-boundary costs.

## What it produces

A manifest-v1 corpus (`.smt2` files + `manifest-representative-v1.json`):
distinct, deduplicated, well-typed QF_BV queries that glaurung's symbolic
engine actually issues while analyzing real Windows drivers, with each
query's **trusted verdict** (from the z3 oracle) and a structural `family`.

## Procedure

1. **Build glaurung with the trusted oracle** (z3 gives the authoritative
   verdict recorded in the manifest):
   ```
   cargo build --release --example ioctlance --features solver-z3
   ```

2. **Capture** (the `GLAURUNG_DUMP_QUERIES` hook in `solve()` writes each
   DECIDED query once as `<sha256>.smt2`, appends `<sha256>\t<verdict>` to
   `index.tsv`, dedup by content hash):
   ```
   export GLAURUNG_DUMP_QUERIES=/path/to/raw-corpus
   export IOCTLANCE_DEADLINE_SECS=400 IOCTLANCE_SOLVE_BUDGET=1000000 IOCTLANCE_SOLVE_SECS=600
   for drv in win10-vwififlt sqfs-intel-DptfDevGen windows-update-intel-audio-IntcSST; do
     cargo run --release --example ioctlance --features solver-z3 -- \
       samples/binaries/platforms/windows/vendor/realworld/$drv.sys >/dev/null 2>&1
   done
   ```
   (2026-07-13 capture: 15,687 distinct queries, 1,797 sat / 13,913 unsat,
   ~290 MB, sizes 30 B - 220 KB, p50 ~9 KB; 97% contain `extract`, 89%
   `concat` -- the width-mixed, extract/concat-heavy target distribution.)

3. **Build the manifest + tiers** (`build_corpus.py`: structural family
   classification, stratified `representative` tier + `full` tier, manifest
   in axeyum's v1 schema; `excluded-hashes.txt` drops the rare
   declared-vs-actual width edge cases axeyum's strict parser rejects):
   ```
   python3 build_corpus.py /path/to/raw-corpus /path/to/pack 6 excluded-hashes.txt
   ```

4. **Validate ingestion + profile** in axeyum:
   ```
   cd ~/projects/personal/axeyum
   cargo run --release -p axeyum-bench --features z3 -- \
     /path/to/pack --corpus-manifest /path/to/pack/manifest-representative-v1.json \
     --corpus-tier representative --backend sat-bv --compare-z3
   ```

## Result (2026-07-13, representative tier, 128 queries)

- **100% decided, 0 unsupported, 0 disagreements** (`manifest_agree=128`) --
  passes axeyum's full acceptance gate (exit 0).
- **Axeyum/Z3 ratio: 2.10x** (axeyum 272 ms, z3 130 ms) -- confirms the
  1.7-3.2x real-workload gap, measured through axeyum's own harness.
- **Cold-path attribution: bit_blast 42% + cnf_encode 42% = 84%, SAT 15%,
  model_lift 1%** (`sat_dominates: false`). The gap is in term->AIG->CNF
  lowering, NOT SAT search -- ranking axeyum's roadmap toward GQ3
  (coercion peepholes) / GQ4 (bit-slice) / GQ5 (AIG->CNF), deprioritizing
  GQ6 (SAT tuning).

## Hand-off

The representative pack is placed (uncommitted) at
`~/projects/personal/axeyum/corpus/glaurung-qfbv/` ready to ingest. The
full ~290 MB tier is regenerable via steps 1-3 (too large to commit; keep
access-controlled). `family`/`tiers`/`content_hash`/`expected` all conform
to `docs/user-guide/corpus-manifests.md`.

## Ordered native Axeyum profile

Build both backends so Z3 remains the authoritative exploration/model-choice
path while Axeyum receives the exact same query stream. On hosts where
`z3-sys` bindgen cannot find GCC's `stdbool.h`, include the GCC header path as
shown:

```sh
export BINDGEN_EXTRA_CLANG_ARGS=-I/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/15/include
cargo build --release --example ioctlance --features solver-z3,solver-axeyum

profile_dir=$(mktemp -d /tmp/glaurung-axeyum-profile.XXXXXX)
GLAURUNG_SHADOW_DIFF=1 \
GLAURUNG_AXEYUM_PROFILE_DIR="$profile_dir" \
IOCTLANCE_DEADLINE_SECS=400 \
IOCTLANCE_SOLVE_BUDGET=1000000 \
IOCTLANCE_SOLVE_SECS=600 \
target/release/examples/ioctlance \
  samples/binaries/platforms/windows/vendor/realworld/win10-vwififlt.sys
```

`GLAURUNG_AXEYUM_PROFILE_DIR` must be set before the process's first native
check. It preserves the raw one-shot policy and writes one
`axeyum-profile-<pid>.jsonl` file per process. Each record carries the SHA-256
of the exact bytes produced by the existing SMT-LIB capture renderer, a
monotone process-local sequence, outcome/completeness, phase durations, and
AIG/CNF sizes. Query rendering/hash and JSON output are diagnostic overhead and
are deliberately outside `total_nanos`.

Validate and summarize from the Axeyum checkout:

```sh
python3 scripts/summarize-glaurung-native-profile.py \
  "$profile_dir"/axeyum-profile-*.jsonl \
  --manifest /path/to/pack/manifest-v1.json \
  --require-100-percent-decided \
  --out "$profile_dir/summary.json"
```

The summarizer fails closed on schema/order/completeness/count/policy drift and
on any overlapping manifest verdict conflict. Keep every JSONL occurrence:
deduplication would destroy the exact-repeat frequency and first-use/order
evidence needed by warm GQ7/GQ8 work. Run the same shadow command without
`GLAURUNG_AXEYUM_PROFILE_DIR` for an ordinary-wrapper timing control; do not
compare an Axeyum-authoritative run because different SAT models can change
Glaurung's exploration and query stream.
