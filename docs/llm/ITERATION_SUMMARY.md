# Agent Iteration Summary

## Current Implementation Analysis

After thorough analysis, I've identified that our agents currently operate in a **single-pass execution model**:

```python
# Current pattern in all agents
result = agent.run_sync(prompt, deps=context)  # One shot
return result.output
```

### Key Findings

1. **No built-in retry logic** - Tools fail without recovery
2. **No confidence tracking** - Can't assess answer quality
3. **No refinement loops** - Can't improve based on initial results
4. **Limited context building** - Each question starts fresh

## Pydantic-AI Capabilities

The framework provides excellent support for iteration through:

### 1. Retry Mechanisms
- `ModelRetry` exception for tool retries
- Validation-triggered retries
- Configurable retry counts

### 2. Fine-grained Control
- `agent.iter()` for step-by-step execution
- Access to intermediate results
- Custom logic injection points

### 3. Graph Workflows
- `pydantic-graph` for complex state machines
- Persistent state across iterations
- Visual workflow representation

## Implemented Solution

I've created:

1. **`iterative.py`** - A complete iterative agent wrapper that adds:
   - Confidence scoring system
   - Multi-iteration refinement
   - Evidence tracking
   - Progressive improvement

2. **`AGENT_ITERATION.md`** - Comprehensive documentation covering:
   - Current limitations
   - Pydantic-AI patterns
   - Implementation strategies
   - Phased rollout plan

3. **`iterative_analysis.py`** - Working example demonstrating:
   - How to use the iterative wrapper
   - Confidence-based termination
   - Evidence accumulation

## How It Works

The new `IterativeAgent` wrapper:

```python
# Instead of single-shot:
result = await agent.run(question, deps=context)

# Now we can do:
iterative_agent = IterativeAgent(agent, strategy)
result = await iterative_agent.run_with_refinement(
    question, 
    context,
    # Automatically iterates until confidence threshold met
)
```

### Iteration Flow

1. **Initial attempt** - Agent tries to answer with available context
2. **Confidence evaluation** - Scores based on evidence, tools used, completeness
3. **Refinement decision** - If confidence < threshold, iterate
4. **Context enhancement** - Add feedback about what's missing
5. **Retry with context** - Agent attempts again with more guidance
6. **Repeat until** - Confidence met OR max iterations reached

### Confidence Factors

The system evaluates confidence based on:
- Explicit confidence in output
- Number of evidence pieces gathered
- Variety of tools used
- Knowledge base exploration
- Result completeness
- Failure history

## Benefits

1. **Higher quality answers** - Agents refine until confident
2. **Transparent process** - Track refinement path
3. **Resilient analysis** - Recovers from tool failures
4. **Progressive results** - Partial answers if complete analysis fails
5. **Configurable strategy** - Adjust iterations, confidence, backoff

## Integration Path

### Phase 1: Testing (Immediate)
- Test `iterative.py` with complex queries
- Validate confidence scoring accuracy
- Tune strategy parameters

### Phase 2: Integration (Short-term)
- Add `--iterative` flag to ask command
- Integrate with existing agents
- Add retry logic to critical tools

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Long-term)
- Graph-based workflows for multi-stage analysis
- Persistent state for interrupted analysis
- Visual debugging of iteration paths

## Example Usage

```bash
# Run the example
python examples/iterative_analysis.py /bin/ls "Is this binary malicious?"

# Output shows:
# - Multiple iterations with increasing confidence
# - Tools used in each iteration
# - Final answer with confidence score
# - Evidence trail
```

## Next Steps

1. **Add retry decorators** to tools in `memory_agent.py`
2. **Test iterative wrapper** with malware samples
3. **Integrate into CLI** with optional flag
4. **Monitor performance** - iteration overhead vs quality improvement
5. **Consider graph workflows** for complex multi-stage analysis

## Key Insight

The single biggest improvement we can make is allowing agents to **learn from their initial attempts** and refine their approach. This mirrors how human analysts work - starting with broad investigation, then narrowing focus based on findings.

The implementation is backward-compatible and opt-in, so we can gradually migrate to iterative patterns where they provide value.
