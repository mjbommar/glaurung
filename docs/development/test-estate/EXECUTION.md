# Execution log

Live status for [`README.md`](README.md) (the estate plan) and
[`../decompiler-parity-backlog.md`](../decompiler-parity-backlog.md) (the
parity backlog). `[x]` landed and verified, `[~]` in flight, `[ ]` not started.

**This file is the todo list.** `TodoWrite` is not available in this session's
toolset, so the plan lives here instead — which is more durable anyway, since
it survives the session and is reviewable in a diff.

## Findings worth keeping

**The inventory was wrong about one thing.** `docs/test-inventory/findings.md`
says two of the three CWD-dead Python files are duplicates. They are not:
`test_symbols_demangled.py` calls `list_symbols_demangled` directly while
`test_demangle_integration.py` checks the same evidence surviving a full
`analyze_path`. Both were kept.

**The 18.8 MB duplication is not a straight delete.** 85 md5-identical pairs,
but same-relative-path is *not* proof of identical content — `mathlib.dll`
exists at both paths and differs. Five pairs are referenced from both sides
and need repointing first. Do this per-file, verifying content, not by path.

**`scripts/lint-rust.sh` is red**: 255 clippy errors on the lib target, 296
with tests, under `-D warnings`. Left alone deliberately; it is a decision to
make, not a thing to silently delete.

**Skips are now visible: 41 of them**, 21 waiting on the gitignored
`tests/fixtures/msvc-pdb/` binaries that nothing fetches (estate 1.7), 7 on
`GLAURUNG_IOCTL_FIXTURES`, 4 on live-LLM opt-in.

## Ground rules

Verified before any claim of done: `cargo test --features python-ext`,
`uv run pytest python/tests/`, `uvx ruff check python/`, `uvx ty check
python/`, and `dectest @o0 @o2` for anything touching the decompiler.
`TMPDIR` exported. No DecBench, no Joern. Every fixture change refreshes the
six side files.

**A readability change is a semantic change.** The comparison-guard fusion
looked purely cosmetic and turned eleven execution-differential lanes red on
its first version. The fixture matrix is the thing that knows.
