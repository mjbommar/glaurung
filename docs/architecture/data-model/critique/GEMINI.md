# Data Model Critique and Unification Plan

This document outlines a critique of the initial `GEMINI.md` data model proposal in light of the more comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` proposal. It provides a set of actionable recommendations to merge the strengths of both, creating a robust and extensible foundation for Glaurung.

The core strategy is to adopt the detailed, feature-rich objects from `CLAUDE.md` for our foundational models while deferring the highly advanced, graph-oriented features to later project phases. This approach ensures we build a strong base without getting bogged down in excessive complexity upfront.

### Recommended Actions

**Action Type:** `MODIFY`
**Object:** `Address`
**Reasoning:** The `CLAUDE` model for `Address` is far more robust, accounting for address spaces and symbolic representation, which is critical for complex binaries. The `confidence` score is a key feature for integrating probabilistic analysis and AI-inferred data.
**Proposed Change:**
- Adopt the `CLAUDE` model for `Address`.
- **Fields to Add:** `space`, `kind`, `width`, `symbol_ref?`, `confidence`.

---

**Action Type:** `ADD`
**Object:** `AddressRange`
**Reasoning:** The `GEMINI` model lacks a dedicated object for a memory range, which is a fundamental concept used in `Segment`, `Section`, and `BasicBlock`. The `CLAUDE` proposal correctly identifies this as a core object.
**Proposed Change:**
- Introduce the `AddressRange` object as defined in `CLAUDE.md`.

---

**Action Type:** `MODIFY`
**Object:** `Binary`
**Reasoning:** The `CLAUDE` model for `Binary` is more comprehensive, including essential metadata like hashes, multiple entry points, and a reference to a future knowledge graph.
**Proposed Change:**
- Enhance the `Binary` object with fields from `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Fields to Add:** `id`, `endianness`, `hashes`, `signatures`, `analysis_state`, `knowledge_graph_ref`.
- **Field to Rename:** `entry_point` to `entry_points` (List of `Address`).

---

**Action Type:** `MODIFY`
**Object:** `Symbol`
**Reasoning:** The `CLAUDE` model for `Symbol` is superior, capturing vital context like demangled names, visibility, and the source of the symbol information (e.g., `DWARF`, `PDB`, `AI_Inferred`), which is crucial for the project's goals.
**Proposed Change:**
- Adopt the `CLAUDE` model for `Symbol`.
- **Fields to Add:** `id`, `demangled?`, `visibility`, `source`, `confidence`.

---

**Action Type:** `MODIFY`
**Object:** `Instruction`
**Reasoning:** The `CLAUDE` model breaks down `Instruction` into more granular and useful components, particularly by introducing a structured `Operand` object and adding semantic groups. This is essential for any deep analysis.
**Proposed Change:**
- Adopt the `CLAUDE` model for `Instruction`.
- **Fields to Add:** `side_effects`, `prefixes`, `groups`.
- **Field to Change:** `operands` should be a list of `Operand` objects, not strings.

---

**Action Type:** `ADD`
**Object:** `Operand`
**Reasoning:** The `GEMINI` model oversimplified operands as strings. A dedicated `Operand` object, as proposed by `CLAUDE`, is necessary for performing any meaningful data-flow or semantic analysis.
**Proposed Change:**
- Introduce the `Operand` object as defined in `CLAUDE.md`.

---

**Action Type:** `MODIFY`
**Object:** `Function`
**Reasoning:** The `CLAUDE` model includes critical fields for deeper analysis, such as calling conventions, local variables, and confidence scores for function boundary detection.
**Proposed Change:**
- Enhance the `Function` object with fields from `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Fields to Add:** `id`, `parameters`, `local_variables`, `calling_convention?`, `is_thunk`, `confidence`.

---

**Action Type:** `ADD`
**Object:** `Variable` and `DataType`
**Reasoning:** The initial `GEMINI` proposal completely omitted explicit models for variables and types. These are fundamental for lifting assembly to a higher-level representation and are excellently defined in the `CLAUDE` proposal.
**Proposed Change:**
- Introduce the `Variable` and `DataType` objects as defined in `CLAUDE.md`.

---

**Action Type:** `ADD`
**Object:** `StringLiteral`
**Reasoning:** Strings are a critical source of intelligence in reverse engineering. The `CLAUDE` model for `StringLiteral`, which includes encoding, references, and classification, is a significant improvement.
**Proposed Change:**
- Introduce the `StringLiteral` object as defined in `CLAUDE.md`.

---

**Action Type:** `DEFER`
**Object:** `KnowledgeGraph`, `BinaryOntology`, `Triple`, and related objects
**Reasoning:** The entire suite of KnowledgeGraph/Ontology objects is a powerful but massive undertaking. These should be considered a **Phase 3 or 4** goal. Implementing them now would add excessive complexity to the foundational stage of the project. The core data models should be designed to *feed into* a knowledge graph, but the graph itself is a separate, advanced feature.
**Proposed Change:**
- Do not implement these objects in the initial phases.
- Design the core objects (`Function`, `Symbol`, etc.) with stable `id` fields and clear relationships that will facilitate their future conversion into knowledge graph nodes and edges.

---

**Action Type:** `DEFER`
**Object:** `AIInsight`, `Embedding`, `Similarity`, `DynamicTrace`
**Reasoning:** Similar to the knowledge graph, these objects represent advanced analysis capabilities that depend on a solid static analysis foundation. They should be deferred to later phases of the project roadmap.
**Proposed Change:**
- Postpone implementation of these objects until the core static analysis engine is mature.

---

**Action Type:** `REFACTOR`
**Object:** `Project` (from `GEMINI.md`) and `Workspace` (from `CLAUDE.md`)
**Reasoning:** These two objects serve a similar top-level purpose. The name `Workspace` is arguably more descriptive for a tool that might handle multiple binaries. The concept of `AnalysisProfile` from `CLAUDE.md` is also a crucial addition for managing analysis configurations.
**Proposed Change:**
- **Merge** `Project` and `Workspace` into a single `Workspace` object.
- The new `Workspace` should contain a list of `Binary` objects and manage analysis sessions and settings, drawing inspiration from the fields in both original proposals.
- **Incorporate** the `AnalysisProfile` object as part of the `Workspace` to manage different analysis configurations.
